# Use Case
- Certain controls of subsystems on the robot
    - Intake
        - This could be really helpful in the intake of cubes vs cones. Asides from shape, the most major difference is the weight of the objects. Because the cubes are inflated, they weigh a significant amount less than the cones. <b>Automatic detection of the gamepiece would allow us to control the speed in which the flywheels move the piece into the "loading area".</b>
    - Claw Assist
        - Object detection could help us position the claw to a cube. <b>self explanatory</b>

- Autonomous Adaptability
    - We can not always be certain that the location of a game piece in autonomous. What if another bot moves/takes our targetted piece? <b>The ability to have an adaptive autonomous would give the bot protection against mistakes/uncertainties in auto.</b>
